Connecting a container network namespace to root network namespace
Let's create a custom network namespace ns0 and a bridge br0. In Linux networking, a bridge is a virtual network device that connects multiple network interfaces, allowing them to function as a single logical network.

sudo ip netns add ns0
sudo ip link add br0 type bridge
Configure a bridge interface
A new device, the br0 bridge interface, has been created, but it's now in a DOWN state. Let's assign ip address and turn it into UP state.

sudo ip link set br0 up
sudo ip addr add 192.168.0.1/16 dev br0
Now let's verify whether br0 is able to receive the packet or not.

Configure virtual ethernet cable
It's time to set up a virtual Ethernet cable. One cable hand will be configured as a nic card in the ns0 namespace, while the other hand will be configured in the br0 interface.

sudo ip link add veth0 type veth peer name ceth0
sudo ip link set ceth0 netns ns0
sudo ip link set veth0 master br0
Both end of this cable is now in DOWN state. Let's turn into UP state

sudo ip netns exec ns0 ip link set ceth0 up
sudo ip link set veth0 up
Configure ns0 namespace
We need to assign an ip address to ceth0 and turn loopback interface into UP state.

sudo ip link set lo up
sudo ip addr add 192.168.0.2/16 dev ceth0
Namespace ns0 to root ns Communication
Let's check the Ip address assigned to primary ethernet interface of host machine.

ip addr show 
Now, ping to this ip address

sudo ip netns exec ns0 bash
ping 10.0.0.25
It says network in unreachable. So, something is not okay. Let's check the route table.

route
The output may look like.

Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
192.168.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     0      0        0 ceth0
This routing table entry indicates that any destination IP address within the 192.168.0.0/16 network should be reached directly through the ceth0 interface, without the need for a specific gateway.

So we need to add a Default Gateway in the route table.

ip netns exec ns0 bash
ip route add default via 192.168.0.1
Now we are good to go! Let's ping again.

sudo ip netns exec ns0 bash
ping 10.0.0.25 -c 5
We have come so far. Now we can ping our root ns or primary ethernet interface from custom namesapce. But can we ping outside the world? Let's ping to 8.8.8.8.

Let's ping to outside world
sudo ip netns exec ns0 bash
ping 8.8.8.8 -c 5
We are not getting any response.

To add SNAT Rule at Host side

sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/16  -j MASQUERADE
Firewall rules
To verify iptables chain and other stuff

sudo iptables -t nat -L -n -v
In case if still it not works then we may need to add some additional firewall rules.

sudo iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface br0 --jump ACCEPT
sudo iptables --append FORWARD --out-interface br0 --jump ACCEPT
These rules enabled traffic to travel across the br0 virtual bridge.These are useful to allow all traffic to pass through the br0 interface without any restrictions. However, keep in mind that using such rules without any filtering can expose your system to potential security risks. But for now we re good to ping!

Test Connectivity
ping 8.8.8.8 -c 5
